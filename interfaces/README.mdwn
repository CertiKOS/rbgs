The files in this directory define general categorical interfaces and
constructions using Rocq's module system. The idea is less to formalize
the categorical concepts, and more to ensure that models with similar
structures follow a uniform interface, and that moderate amounts
of code reuse are possible.

Ultimately, I want us to be able to write things like this,
enumerating the structures we need for a particular application:

    Module Type ObjSem :=
      Category <+ Cartesian
               <+ Tensor
               <+ Before
               <+ CofreeComonoid Bef
               <+ EffectAlgebras
               <+ Enriched CDLat.

Then we could carry out our work independently of a concrete model:

    Module MyThing (C : ObjSem).
      Import C.
    
      ...
    
    End MyThing.

Below I will outline some design principles I used.

# Conventions

## Modules types and modules

In general, for an interface `Foo` we proceed as follows:

  * The module type `FooDefinition` enumerates the data which must be
    provided to define a structure of kind `Foo`.

  * The module `FooTheory` contains standard definitions and properties
    which can be derived from `FooDefinition` and are expected to be
    included with all instances of the structure.

  * The module type `Foo := FooDefinition <+ FooTheory` can be used as
    the overall type for instances of the structure.

Module types and module functors which build further on top of Foo can
depend on an instance of the `Foo` module type, or just `FooDefinition`
in cases where that is sufficient.

For example, the module type `CategoryDefinition` provides standard names
for object and morphism types, a composition operator and its identity,
and their expected properties. The module functor `CategoryTheory C`
provides common definitions and proofs derived from the basic ingredients
provided by the parameter `C : CategoryDefinition`. When `CategoryTheory`
is used with `<+` or `Include` with the parameter left out, Rocq will
attempt to instantiate `C` with the partially defined module into which
`CategoryTheory` is being included. A definition for the category `SET`
may look like the following:

    Module Type Category :=
      CategoryDefinition <+
      CategoryTheory.

    Module SET <: Category.

      (* Objects *)
      Definition t := Type.

      (* Morphisms *)
      Definition m (A B : t) : t := A -> B.

      (* Identity *)
      Definition id {A} : m A A :=
        fun x => x.

      (* Composition *)
      Definition compose {A B C} (g : m B C) (f : m A B) : m B C :=
        fun a => g (f a).

      (* Properties *)
      Proposition compose_id_left :
        ...

      Include CategoryTheory.

      (* We can have more SET-specific definitions here that
        rely on the material provided by [CategoryTheory]. *)

    End SET.

Note that even though this is not declared, the definitions which precede
the `Include` command will satisfy the `CategoryDefinition` interface, so
that they can be used by the common code in `CategoryTheory`.

## Traits

In most cases, in addition to a core interface designated by a noun such
as `Category` or `Functor`, our modules will implement a number of
auxiliary *traits* designated by adjectives such as `Cartesian`, `Enriched`,
`Monoidal`, ... These additional traits follow the same pattern as above
with both a `Definition` interface and `Theory` common code.

Sometimes, an adjective like `Monoidal` can apply to different core
interfaces such as `Category` or `Functor`. In this case the bare name
will be reserved for the more fundamental interface (in this case for
monoidal categories), and the secondary uses can be disambiguated by
prepending the name of the core interface they relate to, as in
`FunctorMonoidal`.

In general, we will want to give names to common combinations of core
interfaces and additional traits, such as `MonoidalCategory`:

    Module Type MonoidalCategory :=
      Category <+
      Monoidal.

    Module Type MonoidalFunctor (C D : MonoidalCategory) :=
      Functor C D <+
      FunctorMonoidal C D.

More specialized combinations can be defined on an as-needed basis; we
will use the name `FooSpec` for a module type which details the interface
implemented by the module `Foo`, and `BarReq` for a module type which
enumerates requirements for the parameter of a module functor `Bar`.

## Naming files

When a Rocq library (say, `Category.v`) which contains a module of the
same name is imported, the name (`Category`) will usually refer to the
nested module defined within the file. However, in some contexts and
especially module expression, it will sometime be necessary to type its
full qualified name (`Category.Category`) to refer to the inner module
rather than the containing file.

To avoid any confusion, we may want to prevent this situation by using
different names for the containing libraries. For example, we may want
to name files in the plural (`Categories.v`, `Functors.v`, ...) where
applicable.

# Tips and tricks

## Dealing with submodules

[Should write something here about the issues that come up and ways to
work around them]

## Module functor instances

Sometimes, when working with module functors, it is useful to know
that a particular module was built in a certain way. For example,
the *free category* construction builds a category from a mere quiver
(a directed multigraph with no composition structure):

    Module FreeCategory (Q : Quiver) <: Category.
      ...
    End FreeCategory.

Then, if given a target category `D : Category` along with a quiver
homomorphism `F : QuiverHomomorphism Q D`, we can define a proper
`Functor` from the free category generated by `Q` into `D`.

However, this functor can only be defined once we have built
an instance of the free category using the module functor above:

    Module C := FreeCategory Q.

    Module IntF : Functor C D.
      ...
      (* Here we interpret the morphisms of [C] (paths in [Q])
       using the mapping provided by [F] and the composition
       operation in [D].  *)
      ...
    End IntF.

To make this construction into a generic module functor, we need
to reify the fact that [C] was constructed as a free category
generated by [Q] into a module type:

    Module Type FreeCategoryInstance (Q : Quiver).
      Include FreeCategory Q.
    End FreeCategoryInstance.

We can then define

    Module IntF (Q : Quiver) (C : FreeCategoryInstance) (D : Category)
        (F : QuiverHomomorphism Q D) <: Functor C D.
      ...
    End IntF.

as a construction which can be used with any free category.

In general, we will use the name `FooInstance` for module types
used in this way.
